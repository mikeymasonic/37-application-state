## Redux Middleware

### Why?

Redux middleware are functions that sit between a dispatched action
and the reducers. They allow us to customize behavior based on the
action. They also allow us to customize behavior after the reducers
finish.

For example:

* we can log every action that redux handles
* we can wait for asynchronous actions
* we can store state in local storage

### What?

Redux middleware takes the form

```js
const myMiddleware = store => next => action => {
  // ...do stuff here
}
```

parameter | description
--------- | -----------
`store`   | the redux store with all of its methods
`next`    | a function to move to the next middleware (returns new state)
`action`  | the incoming (dispatched) action

Middleware can be applied when you create your store:

```js
import {
  createStore,
  applyMiddleware
} from 'redux';
import reducer from './reducers';
import { myMiddleware } from './middleware/myMiddleware.js';

export default createStore(
  reducer,
  applyMiddleware(
    myMiddleware
  )
);
```

### Compose

When we applied middleware before we applied a store enhancer. Middleware
isn't a fundamental part of redux, but is added as an enhancement. We've
used another redux enhancement when we used redux devtools.

To add multiple enhancements we need to `compose` the enhancements together.

```js
import {
  createStore,
  applyMiddleware,
  compose
} from 'redux';
import reducer from './reducers';
import { myMiddleware } from './middleware/myMiddleware.js';

const composeEnhancers = window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION_COMPOSE__ || compose;

export default createStore(
  reducer,
  composeEnhancers(applyMiddleware(myMiddleware))
);
```
